# üå∏ Iris Classifier

> Predict Iris flower species using machine learning (KNN)

---

## üìñ Overview

The **Iris Classifier** is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*, based on four key features. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a simple ML pipeline: loading data, visualizing it, training a model, evaluating performance, and predicting new samples.

### üîç Why this project?

- Learn the basics of supervised learning using the Iris dataset
- Practice Python, data visualization, and ML libraries like `scikit-learn`
- Explore how to build, train, and deploy a classification model
